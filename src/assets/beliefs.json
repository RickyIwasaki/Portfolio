People don't take good care of them like children and if they do then they are using up resources that could have been used on human children. And pets don't have protection like humans do, being abused a lot. Buying pets sponsors them and saving the thrown away pets, is like cleaning up their mess. It should be reported then taken care of. Otherwise the negative consequences aren't shown as easily. Or we can go the other route and treat pets as object. I personally only care about humans, so I only care about other animals just because others care about them so much. I am a person that wouldn't want any animal capable of harming a child on the streets, so that includes cats, dogs, birds, and etc (and quantity matters). Especially bears, there are people in the urban areas saying that the bear shouldn't be killed even though the bears are going after humans, so these rural people are getting hurt or having a risk of it."

Things like money, weapons, ideas, anything, are all accessible somehow, then that means we need to have as many powerful good people to have them to not have the bad people take over and restrict to just the bad people having them. If there are slaves owners, then there should be more good slave owners than bad ones. If there are gun owners, then there should be more good owners than bad ones. Regulating causes to have less good people having access to it and the number of bad people having access to this wont change that much, unless a reputable entity checks every resource at any point, which I don't think any entity is capable of this."

Slavery is bad, but it might have helped accelerate resource extraction which helped give more resource to the community. Monopoly is bad, but it might have helped certain countries to be able to compete and stay afloat, increasing citizen and sometimes their quality of life. Makes me think bad people are bad but what should we do. Should we as a first world country take charge or let them be? We would have to invade and raid the current powers and implement our methods and ideas onto them, which would cost lots of resources and lives. Or should we let them continue to be bad people that take advantage of the vulnerable. However what we think is wrong doesn't mean they think it's wrong. They do their best to improve in their own way. Like how an individual shouldn't invade in others' personal space, communities shouldn't invade in other communities, countries shouldn't invade in other countries."
